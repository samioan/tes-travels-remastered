# Port Roadmap

Tracks `port/`, the actual PC port -- as opposed to [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md),
which tracks the reverse-engineering work that feeds it (now fully done: all
13 classes renamed and compile-checked in [`../src/`](../src/)). Follows the
sibling `shadowkey-decomp` project's precedent (its own `docs/PORT_ROADMAP.md`):
milestone by milestone, each one landing a real, runnable/testable slice
rather than a big-bang rewrite, verified with a smoke-test executable per
milestone rather than just read-through.

## Decisions carried through every milestone

- **Behavioral reimplementation, not byte-exact recompilation.** `../src/`'s
  renamed Java is the reference for *what* every system does; the port is
  ordinary modern C++ that reproduces that behavior, not a mechanical
  transliteration of MIDP-era Java idioms (`Hashtable`, `DataInputStream`,
  MIDP `Canvas`/`Displayable`) into C++ syntax.
- **C++17, CMake + Ninja, MSVC**, matching `shadowkey-decomp`'s toolchain
  and this repo's existing `port/` scaffold.
- **Raw Win32 + GDI (`StretchDIBits`), no SDL2/D3D/GL** -- the original is a
  software-rendered MIDP `Canvas`, so a Win32 window blitting a manually
  computed backbuffer reproduces that architecture directly with zero
  external dependencies, same rationale as `shadowkey-decomp`.
- **176x208 virtual canvas.** Unlike `shadowkey-decomp` (a fixed-hardware
  N-Gage title, confirmed 176x208 from `GRAPHICS_FORMAT.md`), Dawnstar's
  `GameCanvas` reads `getWidth()`/`getHeight()` at runtime and lays out
  around whatever it gets -- MIDP `Canvas` is resolution-agnostic by
  design, and no single confirmed hardware target is documented in
  `CLASS_MAP.md`. **176x208 is a port decision, not a confirmed original
  constant** -- picked because `icon3650.png` (the MIDlet's own suite icon)
  names the Nokia 3650, whose display is 176x208, and because
  `splashtop.png`/`splashbot.png` (152x48 / 152x30) fit comfortably inside
  that width with plausible side margins. Revisit if a real target device's
  screenshot or spec surfaces and contradicts it -- nothing downstream
  should assume this is load-bearing precision the way Shadowkey's 176x208
  is.
- **Assets stay out of the repo.** The port reads `datfiles.lmp`/
  `imgfiles.lmp`/`npcstrings.dat`/the `.png` files from a configurable root
  path at runtime (defaulting to `../extracted/`, this project's existing
  `tools/extract_jar.py` output) -- nothing copyrighted is copied into git,
  same as `shadowkey-decomp`.
- **No scripting engine to port.** Dawnstar has no SimKin-equivalent --
  `ESGame`/`GameCanvas`/`Player`/`Shop` *are* the game logic, directly, in
  Java. So there's no M2-style "embed an interpreter" milestone here; the
  port's job is porting those classes' logic straight into C++ systems.

## Milestones done

- [x] **M0 -- scaffold** (`1944dea`, initial project setup). CMake/MSVC/Ninja
      project proves the toolchain: opens a blank Win32 window. No tick
      loop, no backbuffer, no game logic.

- [x] **M1 -- real tick loop + backbuffer + present** (this session). An
      actual `GameClock` running the real 250ms/4Hz cadence
      (`GameCanvas.run()`'s "steady 250ms tick via `Thread.sleep`", see
      `../src/GameCanvas.java` around line 1248), a 176x208 `Backbuffer`,
      and `StretchDIBits` presentation scaled to the window's client area --
      structurally identical to `shadowkey-decomp`'s M0/M1. Still no game
      logic: proves the loop/presentation architecture only. Verified by
      building and launching `dawnstar_port.exe` (stays up, presents a
      solid-color frame every tick).
- [x] **M2 -- asset foundations** (this session). `BinaryReader`
      (big-endian primitives + `readUTF`-style length-prefixed strings,
      matching `Util.java`/`ESGame.java`'s `DataInputStream` usage) and
      `DatArchive` (the `datfiles.lmp` linear-scan-every-lookup reader,
      `docs/ASSET_FORMATS.md`, faithfully including the *lack* of caching --
      these lookups only happen a handful of times at load, so there's no
      reason to diverge from the original just to be "more efficient"), then
      the first two real data loaders on top of it: `ItemDatabase`
      (`itemsin.dat`+`droppeditemsin.dat`, `../src/Item.java`) and
      `SpellDatabase` (`spellsin.dat`, `../src/Spell.java`). Verified by
      `asset_smoke.exe` against the real `extracted/datfiles.lmp`: 101 items
      across 15 categories, a 43-row loot table, and 25 spells, all with
      sane-looking names/prices/stats (`Hatchet`/`Ice Axe`/`Battle Axe`,
      `Frenzy`/`Shield`/`Deft Security`).

## Milestones next

- [ ] **M3 and beyond (not yet planned in detail):** `imgfiles.lmp` +
      `MonsterDatabase` + `geomin.dat`/`Dungeon` + `DungeonGenerator` (the
      procedural level generator, already fully understood --
      `../src/DungeonGenerator.java`), `charin.dat`/`Player` stats and
      save format, `npcstrings.dat`/`helptext.dat`/`Shop` dialogue, the
      first-person corridor renderer (`GameCanvas`'s
      `CORRIDOR_WALL_TABLE`), and finally `ESGame`'s own screen-wiring loop
      tying it all together. Each gets its own milestone once M1/M2 land
      and the shape of "how much fits in one slice" is clearer -- following
      `shadowkey-decomp`'s pattern of not over-planning milestones far in
      advance of actually reaching them.
